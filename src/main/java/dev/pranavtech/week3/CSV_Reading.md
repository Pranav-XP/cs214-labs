### File Reading Code

```java
// Read the CSV file and populate the PriorityQueue
String csvFile = "students.csv";
String line;
String csvSplitBy = ",";

try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(csvFile))) {
    // Skip the header
    br.readLine();

    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
        String[] studentData = line.split(csvSplitBy);
        int id = Integer.parseInt(studentData[0]);
        String name = studentData[1];
        float gpa = Float.parseFloat(studentData[2]);

        Student s = new Student(id, name, gpa);
        studentPQ.add(s);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **File Path and Variables Initialization**:
   ```java
   String csvFile = "students.csv";
   String line;
   String csvSplitBy = ",";
   ```
   - `csvFile`: This string variable stores the file name (or path) of the CSV file that contains the student data.
   - `line`: A string variable used to store each line of text read from the file.
   - `csvSplitBy`: A string variable that defines the delimiter used in the CSV file, which in this case is a comma (`,`).

2. **BufferedReader and FileReader**:
   ```java
   try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(csvFile))) {
   ```
   - **`FileReader`**: This is a class that reads the file's content as a stream of characters. It is designed for reading character files.
   - **`BufferedReader`**: This class wraps around the `FileReader` to buffer the input, improving efficiency by reading chunks of characters at a time rather than reading one character at a time. This also provides a method (`readLine()`) to read an entire line at once.
   - **`try-with-resources`**: This block automatically handles closing the `BufferedReader` after the operations are done, ensuring no memory leaks or resource contention.

3. **Skipping the Header Line**:
   ```java
   br.readLine();
   ```
   - **`readLine()`**: This method reads the next line of text from the file. In this context, the first line of the file is the header (e.g., `id,name,GPA`), which is not needed for processing. Therefore, this line is read and discarded.

4. **Reading and Processing Each Line**:
   ```java
   while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
   ```
   - **Loop**: The `while` loop continues to execute as long as there is more data to read in the file. The condition `(line = br.readLine()) != null` reads a line from the file and checks if it is not `null`. If the end of the file is reached, `readLine()` returns `null`, and the loop terminates.
   - **`line`**: Each line of the CSV file is read into this variable as a single string.

5. **Splitting the Line into Data Fields**:
   ```java
   String[] studentData = line.split(csvSplitBy);
   ```
   - **`split(csvSplitBy)`**: This method splits the line string into an array of substrings, based on the delimiter defined by `csvSplitBy`, which is a comma. For example, the line `"1,John Doe,4.2"` would be split into `["1", "John Doe", "4.2"]`.
   - **`studentData`**: This array holds the individual pieces of data (id, name, GPA) for each student.

6. **Parsing and Storing Data**:
   ```java
   int id = Integer.parseInt(studentData[0]);
   String name = studentData[1];
   float gpa = Float.parseFloat(studentData[2]);

   Student s = new Student(id, name, gpa);
   studentPQ.add(s);
   ```
   - **`Integer.parseInt(studentData[0])`**: Converts the first element of `studentData` (the `id`) from a string to an integer.
   - **`studentData[1]`**: The second element (the `name`) is already a string and is stored as is.
   - **`Float.parseFloat(studentData[2])`**: Converts the third element (the `GPA`) from a string to a floating-point number.
   - **Creating a `Student` Object**: A new `Student` object is created with the parsed `id`, `name`, and `GPA`.
   - **Adding to PriorityQueue**: The newly created `Student` object is added to the `PriorityQueue` named `studentPQ`. This queue will automatically order the students based on their GPA (as defined in the `compareTo` method of the `Student` class).

7. **Exception Handling**:
   ```java
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   ```
   - **`catch` Block**: This block catches any `IOException` that might occur during file reading (e.g., if the file doesn't exist or can't be read).
   - **`e.printStackTrace()`**: This method prints the stack trace of the exception, providing detailed information about where and why the error occurred. This is useful for debugging.

### Summary

The file reading code reads a CSV file containing student data, parses each line to extract the student's `id`, `name`, and `GPA`, and then stores each student in a `PriorityQueue`. The `PriorityQueue` orders the students by their GPA, which allows the program to easily find the top students eligible for a prize. The use of `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` ensures efficient and straightforward file reading, while exception handling ensures that any errors during the file reading process are caught and reported.
